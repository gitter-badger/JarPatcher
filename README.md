# JarPatcher
JarPatcher allows you to patch jar files on runtime.

Put compiled class files into the classes folder that is generated.

On run time the class files will be loaded in.

Still in development, release builds will be created when everything is fully functional.

# Usage

Arguments are optional
java -jar JarPatcher.jar something.jar "arg1 arg2"
```
